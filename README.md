# Coffee Shop Challenge
This is a simple Python project for the Coffee Shop Challenge, focusing on object relationships between Customer, Coffee, and Order models.

# Project Files
The project consists of the following files:

customer.py: Defines the Customer class.

coffee.py: Defines the Coffee class.

order.py: Defines the Order class.

debug.py: Contains code to test the relationships and functionality of the classes.

# Setup
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Place the customer.py, coffee.py, order.py, and debug.py files in the same directory.

# How to Run
To test the project and see the relationships and aggregate methods in action, run the debug.py file from your terminal:

# -- python debug.py --

This will execute the code in debug.py and print the results to your console, demonstrating the interactions between the Customer, Coffee, and Order objects.
